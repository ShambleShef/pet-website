    <p style="color: orange">Hello! I am Sam's dog Mafalda. I am 15 years old and still cute! I've been living around cats for years and I have some advice for living with our feline friends
    </p>
    <ol>
       <li><strong>Do not try to eat the cat.</strong> They may seem delicious, but I promise it won't end well.</li>
       <li><strong>Lick the cat at your own risk.</strong> Some of them like it, some of them tolerate it and some of them will scratch your eye out.</li>
       <li>Cats hate the following things:
         <ul>
           <li>Water</li>
           <li>Vacuums (we have this in common!)</li>
           <li>Being bitten</li>
         </ul>
    </ol>
    <p style="color: blue">And I am Aaron's cat Daisy! I have never lived with a dog and I am a bit skeptical about them.  Here are some of my primary concerns about dogs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I hear they smell. Especially when they get that gross water stuff on them.</li>
      <li>They make a lot of noise, which would be distressing to my sensitive ears</li>
      <li>They seem so needy what with always demanding attention from the humans</li>
    </ul>
